# WSU-DIP-Term-Project-2020W
Digital Image Processing 2020W Term project of Wayne State University

1. Compute and display the histogram of an image, show parameters such as mean, standard deviation
2. Reducing the number of gray levels (in integer powers of 2, from 256 to 2)
3. Zooming and shrinking an image using nearest neighbor interpolation, Bilinear Interpolation
4. Adjust image contrast and brightness through intensity transformation techniques. Discuss the results from different techniques.
  • Negatives,
  • Logarithm,
  • Power-law,
  • Piecewise-linear transformations, and
  • Histogram techniques.
  • Algorithms developed by your team if any.
5. Image Filtering in both Spatial Domain and Frequency Domain with selection of either (a)or (b). Note: you are welcome to do both for your benefit of learning.
a. Image smoothing. Discuss your results from different filters.
b. Image sharpening. Discuss your results from different filters.
6. Noise Reduction. Discuss your image processing results from different techniques, and/or combination of different techniques.
  • Mean filters: arithmetic, geometric, contra-harmonic;
  • Order-Statistics filters,
  • Adaptive filters
Suggestions: Using the images in the text book to check if your functions work properly.
7. Processing on given images with specific issues. Based on the problems in each image, propose your approach, and given your processed resulting images. Analyze your results with conclusion of what are improved and what need more improvement.
8. Extra related to DIP. This is voluntary for the teams who are interested to go into more depth.
